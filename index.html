        <p>Coloring is calm. Because it's paper-based, it offers an escape from screens.It is a fun passtime! Also when you finish the coloring page, you feel great about it , even if it took a while!It feels like there is something you are working toward!Coloring also helps you show your creative side and even if you think that all that you can do is use some colors to finish a sheet, you are really using creativity!</p>
